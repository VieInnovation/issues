# VieInnovation Issue Tracker

Welcome to the official Issue Tracker for projects developed by VieInnovation — including our flagship project Heartz, the music-focused social media platform.

This repository is dedicated to centralizing bug reports, feature requests, and technical discussions across our projects.

## How to Use

We use GitHub Issue Templates to help streamline and standardize contributions.

When opening a new issue, please select one of the following:

- Bug Report — Found something broken? Help us fix it.
- Feature Request — Got an idea to improve Heartz? Share it.
- Open-ended Issue — For anything else, like questions or general feedback.

If none of the templates fit, you may still open a blank issue if necessary.

## Inactive Issue Policy

To keep our issue tracker focused and clutter-free, we automatically mark inactive issues as `stale` after 90 days of no activity. These issues will be closed after 15 more days if there is still no response.

Issues with labels like `priority`, `never-stale`, or `improvement` are exempt from this rule.

## Community and Support

We are building out our community channels. For now:

- General discussion and support may take place directly in GitHub issues.
- Visit [vieinnovation.dev](https://vieinnovation.dev) (coming soon) to learn more about us.
- Check back soon for our official Heartz Discord (coming soon).

## Repository Highlights

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` — Contains structured issue forms for consistency.
- `.github/workflows/stale.yml` — Automates stale issue management.
- `config.yml` — Customizes the issue creation experience.
